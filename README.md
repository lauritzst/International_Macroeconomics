The objective of this course is to familiarize students with state‐of‐the‐art methods in International Macroeconomics in order to think about important real world aspects such as the effects of globalization and the impact of policies in a globalized world (see course content).

This course provides a state‐of‐the‐art foundation in International Macroeconomics. The students will get to see models that form the basis of much of the research in the field. The models will be used to delve into the following topics (a) Capital Flows and Global Imbalances (b) Financial Crises and Sovereign Default (c) Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Puzzles (d) Monetary Policy in the Open Economy and International Monetary Policy Cooperation. We will also explicitly use the methods to discuss the current worldwide inflation due to energy prices and the possibility of stagflation.
